# Narwhal's Custom Cards
Custom cards for EDOPro.

This is the home of the unofficial card scripting project created to work with the EDOPro Yu-Gi-Oh! duel simulator. The various cards in this repo were created by myself, Lacoodapalooza and others and scripted by Narwhal(that's me!) and are intended to be what we always wanted Konami to create, but they never did...

Card scripts are written in Lua 5.3.
