Custom cards for EDOPro.

This is the home of my unofficial card scripting project created to work with the EDOPro Yu-Gi-Oh duel simulator. The various cards in this repo were created by myself or others and scripted by the one and only Narwhal (that's me!) and are intended to be what we always wanted Konami to create, but they never did...

There is now a new creator/scripter! Good 'ol Lacoodapalooza is hard at work thinking up cards and making them reality.

Card scripts are written in Lua 5.3.
