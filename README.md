# The League of Creative Fellows Custom Cards
Custom cards for EDOPro.

This is the home of our unofficial card scripting project created by Narwhal to work with the EDOPro Yu-Gi-Oh duel simulator. The various cards in this repo were created by Narwhal, Lacoodapalooza and others and scripted by Narwhal(that's me!) and are intended to be what we always wanted Konami to create, but they never did...

There is now a new creator/scripter! Good 'ol Lacoodapalooza is hard at work thinking up cards and making them reality. His work can be found over here: https://github.com/Egitet/lacooda-edo-cstm 

Card scripts are written in Lua 5.3.
